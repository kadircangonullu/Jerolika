This project is a web-based online avatar chat game, similar to Sanalika, which I developed between 2011-2014. It is a platform where players can create virtual avatars and interact with other players in various virtual environments. While developing this project, I used web technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP.
